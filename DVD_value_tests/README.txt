This project aims to test the accuracy of the DVD approach using different values and lengths in the independent vectors.

ideas:

1. Finding two similar or different vectors, plot the graph of them. Then convolve them with two linearly independent vectors. By
adjusting the values and the lengths of the two independent vectors to see the effect of the results graph.
The higher of the distinctions of the two graph the better choose of the two independent vectors.
